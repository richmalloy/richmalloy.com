        My name is Rich Malloy and I am a drummer who has a background playing
        many styles of music from rhythm & blues, country, classical & pop/rock
        with artists including Freedy Johnston (Rolling Stone Songwriter of the
        Year), Brenda Lee (Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame) & Lorrie Morgan (Country
        Music Hall of Fame) on shows such as The Grand Ole Opry, David Letterman
        Show, and the BBC & have toured much of the USA, Ireland, Great Britain
        and Italy. I earned a degree in classical percussion from the University
        of North Texas which included a study in Ghana, West Africa and have
        taken one-off lessons with legends such as Joe Morello & Jim Chapin.
